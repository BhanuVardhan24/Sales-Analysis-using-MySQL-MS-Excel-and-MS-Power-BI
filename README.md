🗂 Data Model

Imported five tables from MySQL:

Customers

Date

Markets

Products

Transactions

Relationships established in Power BI model view for one integrated dataset.

🧹 Data Cleaning

Removed blank values in Markets table.

Filtered out invalid transactions where sales_amount <= 0.

Converted multiple currencies into INR:

if [currency] = "USD" then [sales_amount] * 75 else [sales_amount]


Replaced all currencies with INR for consistency.

Standardized data types for calculation.
